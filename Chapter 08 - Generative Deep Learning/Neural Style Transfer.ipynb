    "# Neural Style Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural style transfer consist of applying the style of a reference image to a targe image while conserving the conent of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](neural-style-transfer.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, *style* means texture, colors, and visual patterns in the image, at caripus spatial scales; and the *content* is the higher-level macrostructure of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key notion behind implementing style transfer is the sam idea that's central to all deep learning algorithms: you define a loss function to specify what you want to achieve, in this case *applying the style of a reference image to a targe image while conserving the conent of the target*. Then an appropiate loss function to minimize would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "loss = distance(style(reference_image) - style(generated_image)) + \n",
    "        distance(content(original_image) - content(generated_image))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `distance`: L2 norm\n",
    "- `content`: function that takes an image and computes a representation of its content (CNNs can encode content) \n",
    "- `style`: function that takes an image and computes a representations of its style (CNNs can encode style)\n",
    "\n",
    "So ->\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preserve content by maintaining similar high-level layer activations between the target content and the generated one.\n",
    "- Preserve style by maintaining similar *correlations* within activation for both lower-level layers and high-level-layers. Feature correlations capture *textures*. "
